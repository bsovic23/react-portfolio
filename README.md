## Project Description

In this project, I am recreating my portfolio with a few additions but instead of using multiple HTML pages, I am building the portfolio in React. The application will contain more information than the original portfolio, but be less amout of code since I will be able to reuse pieces of the portfolio using React components.

## Tools Used in Project

* JavaScript
* React.js
* CSS
